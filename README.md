Description:
This web-app enables people to send their Halkbank credit card expenses email to our app/website, and have the app automatically categorize expenses based on the store the expense was made in. If a store hasnâ€™t been categorized yet, the user should be able to categorize it, and all current and future expenses from the same store should get (re)categorized under the selected category.
