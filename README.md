# Expense Tracker

This web-app enables people to send their Halkbank credit card expenses email to our app/website, and have the app automatically categorize expenses based on the store the expense was made in. If a store hasnâ€™t been categorized yet, the user should be able to categorize it, and all current and future expenses from the same store should get (re)categorized under the selected category.
Project organization:

```
Expenses Tracker
    .vscode
    src
        expensestracker
        expenses
        pages
        templates
            registration
        manage.py
    venv
    .gitignore
    README.md
```

## Quick start
Git clone the repo, and set up your virtual enviroment.
venv instructions:
To create the virtual environment cd to your project's folder (expenses tracker) and run `python -m venv <venv name>` and activate it with `. <venv name>/bin/activate`
Next install the requirements with `pip install requirements` and migrate `python manage.py migrate`
After running migrations, seed the db with default expense categories by loading the fixtures with the following command `python manage.py loaddata seed_expense_categories`.
And finally run your server with `python manage.py runserver`


## Test Receiving Email from Mailgun:

### Quick and Simple Test
1. start up the local sever `python manage.py runserver`
2. start an ngrok tunnel `ngrok http 8000`
3. log in to mailgun and select "Receiving" from the menu on the left
4. Enter the URL you got from ngrok and append the receive email route `/api/receive-email` and hit POST

At this point you should see a success message from mailgun. Now that you've made sure the simple test is successful, you can run a full test with a real email.

### Full Email Test
1. In your list of routes in mailgun, edit the catch_all route.
2. Set the forward URL to your ngrok url and append `/api/receive-email`, then save.
3. Forward the email you received from Halkbank to `expenses@sandboxf44eff04716248648a90336077b7a6ac.mailgun.org`
