# Expense Tracker

This web-app enables people to send their Halkbank credit card expenses email to our app/website, and have the app automatically categorize expenses based on the store the expense was made in. If a store hasnâ€™t been categorized yet, the user should be able to categorize it, and all current and future expenses from the same store should get (re)categorized under the selected category.
Project organization:

```

# Test Receiving Email from Mailgun:

## Quick and Simple Test
1. start up the local sever `python manage.py runserver`
2. start an ngrok tunnel `ngrok http 8000`
3. log in to mailgun and select "Receiving" from the menu on the left
4. Enter the URL you got from ngrok and append the receive email route `/api/receive-email` and hit POST

At this point you should see a success message from mailgun. Now that you've made sure the simple test is successful, you can run a full test with a real email.

## Full Email Test
1. In your list of routes in mailgun, edit the catch_all route.
2. Set the forward URL to your ngrok url and append `/api/receive-email`, then save.
3. Forward the email you received from Halkbank to `expenses@sandboxf44eff04716248648a90336077b7a6ac.mailgun.org`
